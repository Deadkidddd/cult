      <p id="practices" class="cults_1_p">
        1. Animal Sacrifices: for a majority of Adolfo's life he was exposed to animal sacrificing, once older he continued the practice, the way his cult started to form, with his animal sacrificial and magic business.</p>
        <p id="practices2" class="cults_1_p">
        2. Involvement in cartells: with relations with the cartel the cult got deeper into drug traffiking. Aldofa would sell his potions and the violent process of creating the potions to appeal to the cartells and other rich people to gain money.</p>
        <p id="practices3" class="cults_1_p">
        3. Human Sacrifices: 23 deaths based around the cult due to the performance of human sacrifices. Members started with enemies but soon went to civilians or people visiting. They had a shed where these murders took place, drank the potion with the victims body parts, and some would keep jewerly made out of the victims bones.</p>
        <p id="practices4" class="cults_1_p">
        4. Torture: Victims of the cult would be tortured to death, tools such as machetes and hammers would be used against the victims.

    <button id="reasons_btn" class="cults_1">Reasons</button>
    <p id="reasons" class="cults_1_p">
      1. Good Luck & Business, Animal Sacrifices started out as a way for good luck and money, but this evolved into gruesome methods of sacrification.</p><p id="reasons2" class="cults_1_p">
      2. Offered money, with the chance of making more money, Adolfo got more involved with drug trafficking. His involvement in these activities also furthered his liking to the cartell.</p>
      <p id="reasons3" class="cults_1_p">
      3. Better potions, Adolfo preached that human sacrifices and more violent sacrifices would create more powerful potions, wether he believed this or not is not clear but his followers went along with it. Human sacrifices were used in the actual potions, with blood or body parts used in the process, but also were used in other methods of "magic". Bodies were buried positioned to "protect their business" and "evade the police".</p>
      <p id="reasons4" class="cults_1_p">
      4. Torture was supposed to make the potions stronger, some followers would perform the torture the victims while others would watch.
