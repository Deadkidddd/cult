    <!--Information-->
    <button id="how_btn" class="cults_2">How</button>
    <p id="how" class="cults_2_p">Lack of discepline fueled the creation of the cult.</p><p id="how2" class ="cults_2_p">Corrupt officers and government officials allowed the cult to continue to run.</p><p id="how3" class="cults_2_p">The cult offered a sense of security and offered drugs</p><p id="how4" class="cults_2_p">And peoples desire for good luck, immortallity, and other possible wants were seemingly solved with the "potions" created.</p><p id="how5" class="cults_2_p">Aldolfo also incorporated his partners into the cult, with the mix of love and oppurtunity of money, some partners agreed to help, forming part of his cult. </p>
    
    <button id="other_cults_btn" class="cults_2">Other Cults</button>
    <p id="other_cults" class="cults_2_p">Other Cults used similar indoctrination techniques to manipulate people to do certain actions</p><p id="other_cults2" class="cults_2_p">What makes this cult different from some other cults is that the followers knew Aldofo. With his followers coming from girlfriends and boyfriends, his followers had a more personal connection with him.</p><p id="other_cults3" class="cults_2_p">Another difference is the involvement in cartells and powerful people.</p><p id="other_cults4" class="cults_2_p">Lastly with his following based around magic potions and Aldofo being magical, his cult followers blindly followed his say, escalating the cult to murders, kidnappings, and torture.</p>
    
    <button id="conformityy_btn" class="cults_2">Conformity</button>
    <p id="conformityy" class="cults_2_p">This cult shows conformity due to the members constantly being surrounded by eachother.</p><p id="conformityy2" class="cults_2_p">Members were mostly surrounded by like minded people, being part of such a similar minded group, made the thought of `Aldofo going too far` be diminished.</p><p id="conformityy3" class="cults_2_p">And with the added component of the members being partners of Aldofo, charm was already in place, with being fooled into this rich man and then getting put into a community following along with Aldofo's instructions, it would've been much harder to realize something off was happening.</p><p id="conformityy4" class="cults_2_p">With the cult offering a fake sense of security, people conformed easily to the ideology and actions Aldofo preached, leading followers to commit heinous acts.</p>
