  <button id="the_cult_btn">Development of the Cult</button>
  <p id="the_cult" class="cult1">
  He created a business around his potions, the potions "allowing invincibility, luck, ect". In the business realm he was able to obtain cartell and high power positions liking.</p><p id="the_cult1" class="cult1">These cartells and rich entities escalated the cult to get into a higher level of drug trafficking</p><p id="the_cult2" class="cult1">He also encouraged partners he had to "help him", them helping him led to them being involved in the cult. An example being his girlfriend Sarah Aldrete, who helped Aldofo with the cult by being a component in the murdering and torturing of victims.</p><p id="the_cult3" class="cult1">As time progressed Aldofo preached the idea of using human sacrifices, involving the cult into torture, kidnapping, and murder. Him being "magical" led his cult members to follow blindly.</p>
  <button id="why_cult_btn">What makes it a cult?</button>
  <p id="why_cult" class="whyy">The reason why this is a cult is due to the gaslighting that took place. </p>
  <p id="why_cult2" class="whyy">Aldofo would use his "divine" persona to get members to carry out acts they wouldn't think about doing such as murder and torture</p>
  <p id="why_cult3" class="whyy">The housing arrangements also showed cult functionality.</p>
  <p id="why_cult4" class="whyy">With a small apartment where members would live, providing an isolated place to further his members viewpoint in him being “divine” and knowing whats best.</p>
  <p id="why_cult5" class="whyy">The followers were commited of various crimes, but all plead that Aldofo manipulated them into their actions and they felt guilty of their actions.</p>
  <p id="why_cult6" class="whyy">All of these acts plus conformity define Aldofo's cult as a cult</p>
